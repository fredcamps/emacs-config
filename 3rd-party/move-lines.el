;;; Commentary:
;;
;; There are two entry points: `move-lines-up' moves the text up and
;; `move-lines-down' that moves the text down.
;;
;; Copy this file in a directory which is in the Emacs `load-path'.  Then,
;; execute the following code either directly or in your .emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'move-lines)
;;     (move-lines-binding)
;;
;; Now, you can move the line(s) up by M-p or M-<up> or down by M-n or
;; M-<down>.
;;
;;; Code:

(defun move-lines--internal (n)
  "Moves the current line or, if region is actives, the lines surrounding
region, of N lines. Down if N is positive, up if is negative"

  ;; The text area spans from the beginning of the first line (text-start) to
  ;; the end of the last line, '\n' included (text-end). Its coordinates are
  ;; the number of chars from the beginning of buffer.
  ;; The region is within the text area and its coordinates are the (negative)
  ;; numbers of chars from text-end.
  ;;
  ;; E.g.:
  ;;     Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisci elit,\n
  ;;     ^                  ^                    ^              ^
  ;; text-start(1)    region-start(-35)    region-end(-14)  text-end(55)
  ;;
  ;; We assume that point is always ahead the mark, else temporarily we swap
  ;; them.
  ;; If we act on the latest line of the buffer and it hasn't a newline, we
  ;; temporarily add one.
